Wedding Planner

Wedding Planner is an app to help engaged couples simplify decisions related to wedding planning. It also shows choices theyâ€™ve made at the end & how they look together. Users have the option at the end to edit, make changes & delete previous choices.


This version uses React, Redux, Express, Passport, and PostgreSQL, among other libraries common within the ecosystem.


## Create database and table

Create a new database called `wedding_planner` and create a `user` table:

CREATE TABLE "user" (
    "id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    "username" VARCHAR (80) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    "password" VARCHAR (1000) NOT NULL
);


## Development Setup Instructions

- Run `npm install`
- Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and paste this line into the file:
  ```
  SERVER_SESSION_SECRET=superDuperSecret
  ```
  While you're in your new `.env` file, take the time to replace `superDuperSecret` with a private key like `25POUbVtx6RKVNWsz$d9ERB9Bb!6hunDg!$&aPie` to keep your application secure. Here's a site that can help you: [https://passwordsgenerator.net/](https://passwordsgenerator.net/). If you don't do this step, create a secret with less than eight characters, or leave it as `superDuperSecret`, you will get a warning.
- Start postgres
- Run `npm run server`
- Run `npm run client`
- Navigate to `localhost:3000`


## Testing Routes with Postman

To use Postman with this repo, you will need to set up requests in Postman to register a user and login a user at a minimum.

Keep in mind that once you use the login route, Postman will manage your session cookie for you just like a browser, ensuring it is sent with each subsequent request. If you delete the `localhost` cookie in Postman, it will effectively log you out.

1. Start the server - `npm run server`
2. Import the sample routes JSON file [v2](./PostmanPrimeSoloRoutesv2.json) by clicking `Import` in Postman. Select the file.
3. Click `Collections` and `Send` the following three calls in order:
   1. `POST /api/user/register` registers a new user, see body to change username/password
   2. `POST /api/user/login` will login a user, see body to change username/password
   3. `GET /api/user` will get user information, by default it's not very much

After running the login route above, you can try any other route you've created that requires a logged in user!

## Production Build

Before pushing to Heroku, run `npm run build` in terminal. This will create a build folder that contains the code Heroku will be pointed at. You can test this build by typing `npm start`. Keep in mind that `npm start` will let you preview the production build but will **not** auto update.

- Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
- Run `npm start`
- Navigate to `localhost:5000`

Directory Structure:

- `src/` contains the React application
- `public/` contains static assets for the client-side
- `build/` after you build the project, contains the transpiled code from `src/` and `public/` that will be viewed on the production site
- `server/` contains the Express App
